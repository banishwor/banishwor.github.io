### Yek Salai

A digital guide and cultural preservation tool designed to make ancestral Meitei knowledge accessible to the new generation.

### How It Works

1.  **One File for All Apps**: This single, centralized `app-ads.txt` file serves all applications published under my developer account. This is the standard and most efficient practice.
2.  **Store Listing Link**: In the Google Play Store, the "Developer Website" field for each of my apps points directly to the URL of this GitHub Pages site.
3.  **Automated Verification**: Ad networks like Google AdMob are programmed to automatically crawl the linked developer website. They look for the `app-ads.txt` file, read its contents, and verify that my publisher ID (`pub-2126541360640458`) is officially authorized to sell ad inventory in my apps. This process confirms the legitimacy of the ad requests.
